Secondly, Carry out your plan by repeatedly using actions, reasoning over the results, and re-evaluating your plan. Perform Action, Observation, Reflection steps with the following format. Write 'Action:' followed by a json formatted action containing the "tool_name" and "parameters"
 Next you will analyze the 'Observation:', this is the result of the action.
After that you should always think about what to do next. Write 'Reflection:' followed by what you've figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next including if you know the answer to the question.
